# fullcircle
A minecraft spell-casting mod inspired by Vazkii's [Psi](https://psi.vazkii.net/) mod. The spells are built in-world with glazed terracotta, and the mod adds (almost) no new blocks. A basic spell example is included below, and more info can be found on this project's [wiki](https://github.com/Shylie/fullcircle/wiki).

<sup>Note: Red glazed terracotta closest to the lime glazed terracotta is labeled <i>minecraft</i>, the other is labeled <i>lightning_bolt</i>. This is done using a piece of named paper.</sup>
